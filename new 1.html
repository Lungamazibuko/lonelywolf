hello guys welcome to Lunga's website , here in my website we are going to learn few things about html language.

				what is html?
html stand for hyperTex markup Language ,you can also refer to html as the language for describing the structure of Web pages.
html use tags to identify content,used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within 
a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

				Advantages and Disadvantage of using html language
				
-HTML is widely used.
-Every browser supports HTML Language.
-Easy to learn and use.
-HTML is light weighted and fast to load.
-Do not get to purchase any extra software because it’s by default in every window.
-Easy to use
-Loose syntax (although, being too flexible won’t suit standards).
-HTML is easy enough to write
-HTML is that it is easy to code even for novice programmers.
-HTML also allows the utilization of templates, which makes designing a webpage easy.
-Very useful for beginners in the web designing field.
-HTML can be supported to each and every browser, if not supported to all the browsers.
-HTML is built on almost every website, if not all websites.
-HTML is increasingly used for data storage as like XML syntax.
-Free – You need not buy any software.
-HTML is present in every window by default so you not need to buy the software which cost too much.
-HTML has many tag and attributes which can short your line of code.


Disadvantages : 
 
 -It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it’s a static language.
-Making the structure of HTML documents becomes tough to understand.
-Errors can be costly.
-It is the time consuming as the time it consume to maintain on the colour scheme of a page and to make lists, tables and forms.
-It can create only static and plain pages so if we’d like dynamic pages then HTML isn’t useful.
-Required to write a lot of code for just creating a simple webpage.
-We have to check up the deprecated tags and confirm not to use them to appear because another language that works with HTML has replaced the first work of the tag, and hence the opposite language needs to be understood and learned.
-Security features offered by HTML are limited.
-If we need to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity.
-HTML can create only static and plain pages so if we’d like dynamic pages then HTML isn’t useful.
-I need to write down tons of code for creating an easy webpage.
-Security features are not good at HTML.
-If we’d like to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity
